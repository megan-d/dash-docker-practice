# Dash

Dash is a full-stack issue tracking, project management, and coding collaboration application that provides software professionals with a platform to both manage their projects and find other developers to collaborate with. The application is built with React, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express. User authentication is handled with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and validation is done on both the client and server side. Global application state is managed with React's Context API, while layout and styling is done with Material-UI and Styled Components.

Upon creating an account, a user can create projects, add tickets, define sprints, view the catalog of developers available to collaborate with, and communicate with other developers. The user's custom dashboard features charts and tables that provide a visual snapshot of what they are working on and the status of some of their work.

If you would like to view the functionality of the application without creating an account, you can select the 'Demo Now' button on the landing page. This will log you in as a demo user and allow you to try the full functionality of the application without having to create an account.
